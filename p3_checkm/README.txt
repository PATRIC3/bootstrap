After checkm is installed, you will have to set the dataRoot location and download the reference databases. 

The command is "/disks/patric-common/runtime/bin/checkm update data"

I couldn't automate it because I couldn't figure out how to interact with checkm while it is executing. While executing, checkm prompts the user for input.

The question is:
It seems that the CheckM data folder has not been set yet or has been removed. Running: 'checkm data setRoot'.
Where should CheckM store it's data?
Please specify a location or type 'abort' to stop trying: 

The answer is:
/disks/patric-common/runtime/checkm


The question is:
32 new file(s) to be downloaded from source
0 existing file(s) to be updated
1.39 GB will need to be downloaded
Confirm you want to download this data
Changes *WILL* be permanent

The answer is:
